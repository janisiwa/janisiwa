## Hi, 👋 I'm Janis

I'm a software engineer in training with a focus on building intuitive, user-friendly applications. I'm currently pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science at Western Governors University (graduating July 2025), and I bring an earlier background in Engineering Science (University of Virginia) and tech leadership in K–12 education.<br/>

Before diving into software development, I worked as a Technology Manager at Broward County Public Schools, where I led systems improvements, drove tech adoption, and translated complex ideas for non-technical users. These experiences shaped how I think about usability, accessibility, and the power of clear communication in tech.<br/>

I’m especially interested in the overlap between software development, UX research, and UI design. I enjoy writing code that improves how people interact with technology—and I’m always learning.<br/>

🔧 Tools I'm using: Git, IntelliJ, VS Code, PyCharm<br/>
💻 Languages/Frameworks I'm using: Java, Python, C++, Spring, React<br/>
🌱 Currently learning: Front-end fundamentals, back-end fundamentals, UX principles<br/>
🤝 Open to collaboration on: Beginner-friendly projects with a user focus<br/>
